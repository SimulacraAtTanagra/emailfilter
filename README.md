## The purpose of this project is as follows:
This project procedurally handles mail based on dynamic organizational roles. 
## Here's some back story on why I needed to build this:
Working at an organization with a certain amount of churn, I found myself often revisiting my outlook rules and coming to a place where I had long deprecated rules sitting alongside brand new ones and outlook no longer permitting the creation of new rules. This program is a way for me to avoid outlook's constraints while optimizing my inbox in a procedural way that is also open to extension. 



The expected frequency for running this code is Continuously.
